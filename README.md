## Why?
Sometimes we use the Node.js REPL interface to experiment with code.
Wouldnâ€™t it be great to have that interface with lodash required by default?

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install -g n_
```

## Usage

```shell
$ n_
n_ >
```

lodash is now attached to the REPL context as `_`, so just use it:

```shell
n_ > _.compact([0, 1, false, 2, '', 3]);
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
n_ >
```

__Note:__ The `_` character is special in the Node REPL (see [nodejs.org/api/repl.html](http://nodejs.org/api/repl.html#repl_repl_features)).
**n_** redirects this special variable to `$`.

Enjoy!
